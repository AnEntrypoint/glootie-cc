Assign wfgy mutables to any issues that remain, to troubleshoot and fix them then scan the codebase to see if there are any other areas that should also be updated because of these changes, then use WFGY to determine if there's architectural changes that must now happen, and finally if the project is deployable, deploy it, if it's an npm project, publish it, and merge and sync the github intelligently, then clean up any files we've left behind in the codebase, that aren't part of the program's permanent structure, and use WFGY the selection of code if there's any complexity in the github merge to ensure we intelligently merge additions and removals whenever they represent an intentional advancement in the codebase.

Mandatory: there must only be one comment in every file, at the top of the file, with a super compact description of the technical caveats, intended exports and imports, relationship to the rest of the program structure and internal function of it, we must ALWAYS update the spec of each file we edited, if we see a code file with no spec at the top, it must immediately be added, we must immediately remove any comments we find that's not that comment, no exceptions. Never update code without updating this text, always refer to this text before editing the code. If our codebase analysis exposes files with more or less than one comment, fix it immediately. Use MCP playwright never use regular playwright.
