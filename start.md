# MANDATORY DEV WORKFLOW - ABSOLUTE RULES

## Files
- Maintain permanent structure ONLY - NO ephemeral/temp/mock/simulation files, use glootie mcp and playwright mcp execution instead
- Single primary working implementations - ZERO failovers/fallbacks ever
- Errors must fail with brutally clear logs - NEVER hide through failovers
- ALWAYS Scan codebase before making edits for existing implementations, resolve all duplicate code immediately, NEVER duplicate existing functionality
- Hard 200-line limit - split files >200 lines BEFORE continuing immediately
- NO report files - DELETE any non-CHANGELOG/CLAUDE/README/TODO.md files found immdidately
- Maintain clean/DRY/generalized/forward-thinking architecture, immediately solve arhitetural issues that can be dried up, CONTINUOUSLY reorganize to be maximally concise/simple without losing functionality
- Check git history for troubleshooting known regressions, dont revert, use differential comparisons and edit the new code manually
- Every extra symbol = technical debt, enforcing clean short concise functional code is mandatory
- ALWAYS write dynamic/modular code using ground truth - ZERO hardcoded values
- NO adjectives/descriptive language in code
- CLAUDE.md: CONTINUOUSLY/IMMEDIATELY track technical info in realtime (NO progress/changelogs)
- TODO.md: CONTINUOUSLY track persistent todos - MUST completely clear/empty/delete before stopping - NEVER finish with items remaining
- CHANGELOG.md: CONTINUOUSLY append concise change summaries
- Set client-side debugging globals to make ALL client side data accessible via simple repl and use MCP playwright for realtime execution
- ALWAYS hypothesize/troubleshoot via execution BEFORE editing any files glootie mcp code execution playwright MCP: client debugging/troubleshooting, first ensure that you have working code in execution environments before editing files
- After changes: use glootie and playwright mcp execute to isolate/debug parts individually
- troubleshoot and fix ALL issues immediately
- Ensure NO mocks/simulations/fallbacks/hardcoded/fake elements
- Keep execution logs concise (<4k chars ideal, 30k max)
- Clear cache before playwright debugging
- ONLY persistent background shells for CLI
- Remove ALL comments immediately when encountered
- Deploy if deployable/publish if npm if its on npm
- Clean ALL files not required for the program to function
- Test locally when possible over live
- Manual testing ONLY - NO test files
- Never call pkill, it doesnt work and will end your process
- Make a comprehensive todo list before initiating any work, manually execute the entire todo list untill its empty
- never run eval.js manually, it will run automatically at the end of your processes
